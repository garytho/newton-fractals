# newton-fractals
This is a short code to generate fractals using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton's Method</a> - an algorithm for iteratively approximating the zeros of nonlinear functions. 

I was inspired to make this repo by this book, which I highly recommend.

Although Newton's Method has guaranteed (fast) convergence under certain conditions, when those conditions are not met, Newton's Method can behave chaotically.

# Here are some pictures of the results. A more detailed explanation of how Newton's Method works is forthcoming.

# Be warned, if you give your polynomial too many roots it will look rather boring:
